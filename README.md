# ComparisonSorts
Description:
  In this assignment you will be implementing several sorting algorithms. In addition, each time you run a sorting algorithm, you will be collecting statistics about the sort. The statistics for each sort will include the number of comparisons, the number of data moves, and the time required by the sort. By generating these statistics, we can compare the performance of the different sorting algorithms in practice and see how our results match up with the complexities we derived for each algorithm.

  For this assignment, you may use any code or algorithms given in the on-line reading on sorting, in lecture, or in the documentation for the ComparisonSort class. You may not use any other sources to develop or create the code for your sorting algorithms.

Goals:
The goals of this assignment are to:

  Gain experience instrumenting code.
  Gain experience measuring elapsed time in Java.
  Implement several sorting algorithms.
  Gain experience writing and using static methods
  Analyze the results of your program to better understand how your program behaves.
